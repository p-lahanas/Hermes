** Remove requirements and use poetry

Data Layer:
- Can convert json to pandas object (recursively on smaller elements until we have nested df with all the data)
- Need a way
to manage downloaded data more effectively

Logging:
- Figure out the logging approach for this project

Requirements:
- Figure out how I'm going to manage package dependencies
- Will start with a requirements.txt but will probs just make a docker image??

Getting Banned:
- Research how they detect us doing this and make sure they can't ban
- Need to blend in as a 'recreational' user... I mean we are kinda

Discord Bot:
- Add a command that call the update anyway
